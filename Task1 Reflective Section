## Breakdown of How My Script Handles Arguments and Options

First, the script checks if the user gave enough arguments.
It reads the options (-n, -v) and allows them to be combined like -vn.
Then it searches the file and prints matching or non-matching lines, with line numbers if needed.

## If I Added Regex, -i, -c, or -l

I would need to add more flags for each option and use better parsing with getopts.
For regex, I would use a different way to match patterns.
For -c, I would just count the matches. For -l, I would print the filename if thereâ€™s a match.

## Hardest Part

The hardest thing was dealing with combined options like -vn.
Also, making the script show the right lines when using -v was a little tricky.
